<p>I am currently 20 year's old and a year 2 student in <em>Asia Pacific College</em> enrolled on the section <strong>BSIT-MI221</strong>.</p>
<p> I chose this course because I want to learn more about how to create my own webpages to improve<br>
	my portfolio and apply them on my future potential jobs.</p>

<p> Currently applying a Public School Scholarship to help me when it comes to the school tuition</p>

<li>Java</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Drawing Digital Art</li>
<li>Playing Video Games</li>
<li>Making recorded videos and editing them</li>
</ol>

<p>My goals in life right now as a student is to finish school and focus on my career</p>
